What denotes an object or action as ‘artistic’? Consider Walter Benjamin’s notion of an “aura” possessed by an art object.<br>
<br> In trying to think of a metaphor for an immaterial and (in some ways) undetectable quality radiating from an artwork, I first considered “radioactivity,” but the Cold-War-era science and culture connotation of the image left me a little, well, cold.

<i><b>‘What if the work was haunted?’</b></i><br /><br />The artist imbuing the object with its ‘ghost’ could be cast as either a conjurer/necromancer who elicits and implants a strange agent in the work, or as a dowser/medium, who detects and indicates an auspicious quality that was already present in the object but previously invisible. Both interpretations are interesting and feel true, and I like the ambiguous allowance for both.

A ghost is also something that is initially frightening, but whose ‘ghastliness’ can be explained away with proper semantic framing. Likewise a challenging work can be seen as a cultural or intellectual threat to someone with little art experience, but when framed properly can be demystified to a degree and made relatable.<br /><br />However, just as a materialist worldview doesn’t preclude one being frightened by a ghost story or a convincingly ‘haunted’ atmosphere, no amount of framing or explanation can divest a great artwork of all of its spectral power.</div>

The idea of<strong> linking two immaterial entities</strong> (art and ghosts) also produces a kind of open, ungrounded metaphor (like “God is love”), which produces more questions than explanations.<br />
<br /> 
To open this idea up a bit more (perhaps at my own peril), I link this “ghost” to its German antecedent “<strong>geist</strong>”, which encompasses and combines the semantic space divided by English into ‘<strong>ghost</strong>,’ ‘<strong>spirit</strong>,’ and ‘<strong>mind</strong>’ (a space where a creative ‘brainstorm’ can be a ‘<strong>geistesblitz</strong>,’ or ‘ghost flash’!). This lets me scaffold different curricular goals/domains under the auspices of different varieties of ‘geist’:</div>

<div style="position:absolute; top:2480px; left:323px; width:638px;">
The <strong>zeitgeist</strong>, the “time ghost,” is related to Hegel’s use of “weltgeist” (“world spirit”) and “volksgeist” to describe “spirit” as a sort of active agent of history.<br>
<br />The zeitgeist relates to the art educational practice of looking to history to inform artistic practice. By recreating the (mental/physical/creative) process of an artist from another time, I can experience the spirit that animated them to make that art, and relate it to my own life and practice.<br /><br />Art education’s attitude toward history should suss out these ancient ghosts to make sure that the historically-informed work made by students is living and auratic, and not simply a facsimile.</div>

<div style="position:absolute; top:3033px; left:10px; width:638px;">
<strong>Poltergeists</strong> are noisy, aggressive, and anarchic spirits. In popular imagination and in credulous parapsychological fields, they are often associated with the traumatic emotions of younger members of a household.<br />
<br />The poltergeist facet of the metaphor encompasses art’s role as a channel for the emotions, a tool for transgressing rules, and a way of being heard. It is expressive, destructive, and LOUD.</div>

<div style="position:absolute; top:3540px; left:323px; width:638px;"> 
The <strong>Heilige Geist</strong> reflects art’s ability to communicate and connect. Just as the spirit in the Pentecost story bridged the Babel-babble of dialects between the assembled disciples, art can succeed at communicating ideas where traditional verbal communication fails. <br />
<br />Students can give their work worth in one way by communicating meaning through it. Art can also foster engagement within a community and create a space for meaningful interpersonal interactions such as play, dialogue, and exchanging gifts.
